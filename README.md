# Learning Portfolio

## What is this purpose of this Git repository?

The purpose of this Git repository is to document and display all my past work this
this course, COMP 20. 

## What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3: The Server for the Private Car service. This 
is my favorite assignment because I got to learn how a backend functions with the front end. 
It was interesting to finally see the concept of a server in code. 

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

My first experience web-developing was in Jumbocode where I jumped right into trying to understand REACT components, javascript, css, and node.js. After this class, I finally understand everything I've been doing, and more. This course has made me confident in my growing skill set in web development. 

## What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

- NEVER trust user input:
	Assignment 4 really showed me how important it is to validate user input as that could be
	a source of vulnerability to malicius attacks like XSS. 

	In one lecture, Ming strong emphasized the importance of NEVER trusting user input, in his lecture about security. 



## Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	
I want to delve deeper into Artificial Intelligence, perhaps Machine Learning.
